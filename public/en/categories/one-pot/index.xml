      <title>Microwave Steamed Eggs</title>

      <description>Steamed eggs, or what I called 炖蛋 growing up, has always been one of my comfort foods. My grandma used to make it for me when I was sick, and it was one of the first things I learned how to cook. It&amp;rsquo;s also so simple &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s just a savory, super simple steamed egg dish. It&amp;rsquo;s technically an egg custard, but that sounds scary, and this isn&amp;rsquo;t complicated or scary at all. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard of the Japanese dish chawanmushi or the Korean dish gyeran-jjim, this is in a similar vein. It&amp;rsquo;s lowkey, homey, and comforting, and as a bonus you&amp;rsquo;re practically guaranteed to have the ingredients you need to make it at home.</description>

      <title>Red Curry Fried Rice</title>

      <description>Fried rice is one of my favorite meals to make. It’s the perfect clean-out-the-fridge dinner, and it’s quick and so easy to cook. Growing up, my grandparents would make egg fried rice with leftover pork or even ham and frozen mixed vegetables.</description>

      <title>Shrimp &amp; Egg Stir Fry</title>

      <description>When I was young, we used to get takeout from this one place in Chinatown (I don’t know the name, sadly.) I specifically remember this one dish I loved: their stir-fried shrimp and eggs.</description>

      <title>Garlic Chive &amp; Egg Stir Fry</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/garlic-chive-egg-stir-fry/</link>

      <description>Unlike chives, which you’d normally think of as an aromatic, garlic chives are treated like a vegetable and used in stir-fries, dumpling fillings, and more. My favorite way to cook them is very simple, just quickly stir-fried with some scrambled eggs. The chives bring a refreshing, delicious flavor to the dish, and it’s absolutely delicious! It’s also so quick to whip up for dinner on a busy day.</description>

      <description>Creamy, spicy, savory, coconutty…this soup is possibly one of the best things I’ve ever made. My family definitely agrees – whenever I make this, it’s gone in a day! It’s a great comfort food for winter and also great to make in the summer, since I always crave spicy food in the summer. I love this soup so much!</description>

      <title>Brown Rice &#39;Jambalaya&#39; (Instant Pot Recipe!)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/jambalaya/</link>

      <description>I love jambalaya. It’s traditionally not pescetarian, so I swapped chicken for mushrooms and used vegetarian sausage to make my version. I also used brown rice instead of white rice, since that’s my family’s favorite type of rice. It also adds body to the jambalaya, so I prefer using it, even though it isn’t traditional. Since I don’t usually have the patience to cook the rice on a stovetop, I used my instant pot instead to make it.</description>

      <title>Creamy Tomato Penne</title>

      <description>I love pasta alla vodka, but it does require two pots – one to boil the water, and one to mix the sauce. I was craving a good tomatoey pasta the other night, and I happened to have the idea to try a one-pot version, where the pasta cooks in the sauce (please don’t come for me, Italians.) The pasta turned out delicious, and it was so easy to make that I knew I had to put it in a recipe!</description>

      <title>Ratatouille Shakshuka</title>

      <description>I know this probably sounds weird, but ratatouille + shakshuka is a surprisingly good combo. If you’ve never heard of ratatouille before, it’s a French Provencal vegetable stew typically made with the freshest of summer produce – zucchini, tomatoes, eggplant. Shakshuka is a dish of eggs poached in tomato sauce, which has many variations that can be found around the Mediterranean and Northern Africa.</description>

      <title>Honey Soy Salmon</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/honey-soy-salmon/</link>

      <description>Salmon is a popular and easy dinner to make. A common way to make it is roasting it in the oven, which I used to do all the time. Except the problem is, I kept ending up with overcooked salmon, because the oven was too hot. And using the oven is such as hassle – you have to preheat it, and defrost the salmon, and what not.</description>

      <title>Broccoli Cheddar Soup</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/broccoli-cheddar-soup/</link>

      <description>Who else loves broccoli cheddar soup? I adored it as a kid, but really only from Panera Bread. Unfortunately, I’ve had quite a few bad broccoli cheddar soups in my life (school cafeteria, anyone?) — floury, bland, watery, and sometimes the broccoli inside would still be crunchy (yikes). But Panera’s was really good: creamy, savory, and deliciously cheesy.</description>

      <description>Fritattas are a great dish to make anytime: They’re easy to whip up, and they’re great for pretty much any meal. Plus, they’re super customizable, and you can use them to clean leftover produce out of your fridge. You can customize the mix-ins if you desire!</description>
