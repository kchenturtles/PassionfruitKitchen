      <description>Creamy, spicy, savory, coconutty…this soup is possibly one of the best things I’ve ever made. My family definitely agrees – whenever I make this, it’s gone in a day! It’s a great comfort food for winter and also great to make in the summer, since I always crave spicy food in the summer. I love this soup so much!</description>

      <description>Who else loves broccoli cheddar soup? I adored it as a kid, but really only from Panera Bread. Unfortunately, I’ve had quite a few bad broccoli cheddar soups in my life (school cafeteria, anyone?) — floury, bland, watery, and sometimes the broccoli inside would still be crunchy (yikes). But Panera’s was really good: creamy, savory, and deliciously cheesy.</description>
