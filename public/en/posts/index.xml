      <title>Sunshine Smoothie Bowl</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m excited about this one! It&amp;rsquo;s so simple yet so good - I think I&amp;rsquo;ve made it like six times this month already. I call it a sunshine smoothie bowl because of the color, but to be more specific, it&amp;rsquo;s a tropical smoothie bowl - mango, pineapple, banana, and anything else you might want to add. It&amp;rsquo;s super easy to make &amp;ndash; just some blended frozen fruit and yogurt &amp;ndash; and it tastes just like mango sorbet.</description>

      <title>Butternut Squash Lasagna</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/butternut-squash-lasagna/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/butternut-squash-lasagna/</guid>
      <description>This recipe actually came about at my sister&amp;rsquo;s request! She was visiting home and telling me about this dish she makes at college: lasagna with butternut squash. When I at first heard that, I was so skeptical &amp;ndash; after all, it seems like something that would get you in trouble with generations of Italian tradition. But she likes it a lot, so I figured that I would give it a try and see if I could improve on it.</description>

      <title>Chewy Brown Butter Mochi</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/chewy-butter-mochi/</link>

      <description>Butter mochi is becoming more popular these days, or at least I hear about it more often on the food side of Instagram and on trendy cafe menus. I do think that when cultural dishes like this start being seen as &amp;rsquo;trendy,&amp;rsquo; it&amp;rsquo;s important that people stay respectful to history of the original dish.</description>

      <title>Cheesy Shells</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/cheesy-shells/</guid>
      <description>This is my favorite mac and cheese recipe. It&amp;rsquo;s got tons of flavor, and it uses shell pasta instead of elbow macaroni because shells are the superior pasta shape (and yes, I will die on this hill). It&amp;rsquo;s extra saucy, because the saucier the better. It&amp;rsquo;s salty, cheesy, and has a bit of a kick; peak comfort food right here.</description>

      <title>Slow Cooker Applesauce</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/slow-cooker-applesauce/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/slow-cooker-applesauce/</guid>
      <description>I had wayyy too many apples in the fridge. Like, maybe 15? Some of them were getting far too old to keep storing, and it was time to find a way to use them up. Usually with apples, I would make apple crisp or apple pie, but with robotics season underway, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really have time. So my solution? Slow cooker applesauce! It&amp;rsquo;s great because you can set it and forget it until it&amp;rsquo;s ready, it tastes great, and it makes the house smell so cozy, which is just what you need in the dreary winter months. (Now the only question is squeezing 10 apples into my slow cooker&amp;hellip;)</description>

      <title>Breakfast Strata</title>

      <description>This might be the best thing I&amp;rsquo;ve ever made. And that&amp;rsquo;s saying a lot, but I made this for my family this Thanksgiving, and everyone pretty much agreed with that sentiment, so count that as evidence if you wish. This dish is a take on strata, which is a bit like a savory bread pudding.</description>

      <description>Wow, life has been busy recently! I&amp;rsquo;ve been sticking to the simple recipes to get by: just a couple of ingredients, not too many dishes dirtied, less prep work. Luckily for me, these vegetarian pigs in a blanket check all of those boxes, and they make a great appetizer or snack any day.</description>

      <title>Ube Mooncakes</title>

      <description>Mooncakes are a symbolic dessert eaten on the Mid Autumn Festival. They are decorated with elaborate stamped designs and characters on top. Traditionally, mooncakes are baked pastries with a rich filling. The pastry layer is akin to a soft cookie, while the filling can be savory or sweet. Traditional fillings include lotus seed paste with salted egg yolk, red bean paste, mixed nutes, and jujube or date paste.</description>

      <title>The Best Cheesecake Bars</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/cheesecake-bars/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/cheesecake-bars/</guid>
      <description>While springform pan cheesecakes are impressive when you do get them right, I prefer to hedge my bets by making cheesecake bars. I actually like them more than traditional springform pan cheesecakes because they have a higher crust to filling ratio, and I think it makes it more texturally enjoyable. And, as a bonus, cheesecake bars are much harder to mess up!</description>

      <title>How To Set Up a Cheeseboard</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/how-to-set-up-a-cheeseboard/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/how-to-set-up-a-cheeseboard/</guid>
      <description>This is more of a guide than a recipe, to be honest, since there isn&amp;rsquo;t any cooking involved. Cheeseboards are the OG girl dinner, in my opinion &amp;ndash; just ingredients laid out to assemble and eat. They&amp;rsquo;re a lot of fun to make and share with family and friends, and if you spend just a little time arranging them, it can make any gathering feel a little bit special. I always used to see all these photos of fancy cheeseboards on Instagram and Pinterest, and I’d wish I could make something similar.</description>

      <title>Vegetable Fritatta</title>

      <description>Fritattas are a good weeknight staple: They’re easy to whip up, and they’re great for pretty much any meal. Plus, they’re super customizable, and they&amp;rsquo;re a convenient way to clean leftover produce out of your fridge.</description>

      <title>Oatmeal Muffins (5 ways!)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/oatmeal-muffins-5-ways/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/oatmeal-muffins-5-ways/</guid>
      <description>A lot of muffins I find in stores are very sweet and very dry, so I prefer to make my own. Homemade muffins are the best, especially warm out of the oven. They only need a bowl and a whisk, and they’re so easy to adapt upon and make different variations with. This recipe has no refined sugar and uses oats for added fiber and texture.</description>

      <description>Happy Valentines Day! In honor of the holiday, I figured I should take advantage of the bottle of pink food coloring in my baking cabinet (it&amp;rsquo;s actually the only color of food coloring I have). This recipe is inspired by hanami dango, which is one of the cutest desserts ever, in my opinion. I love dango it is so simple, not too sweet, and so chewy. Traditionally hanami dango are pink, white, and green, but I made it with just pink and white for Valentines Day.</description>

      <title>Broccoli Cheddar Soup</title>

      <description>Who else loves broccoli cheddar soup? I adored it as a kid, and for me, the quintessential benchmark was Panera Bread&amp;rsquo;s rendition &amp;ndash; comfort in a bread bowl. Unfortunately, I’ve had also quite a few bad broccoli cheddar soups in my life (school cafeteria, anyone?) — floury, bland, watery, and sometimes the broccoli inside would still be crunchy (yikes). But, in pursuit of the Panera Bread dreams of my childhood, I took to experimenting with making it at home.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/baked-brie/</guid>
      <description>This is a festive dish that looks fancy, tastes amazing, and is actually very simple to make! It&amp;rsquo;s a riff on Baked Brie, which is a common holiday appetizer, but reimagined to be in individual pastry form. It makes a great appetizer.</description>

      <description>This fall, I got introduced to Korean egg toast from a restaurant that opened up in a nearby mall, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I&amp;rsquo;ve had it at least eight times this month. It&amp;rsquo;s so good &amp;ndash; the softest, fluffiest egg ever, folded into sweet brioche bread and topped with the perfect sweet-and-savory sauce. I also like it topped with cheese and avocado. Of course I had to try to figure out how to make it at home, so here is what I came up with.</description>

      <title>5 Spice Pumpkin Pie</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/5-spice-pumpkin-pie/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 20:24:40 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/5-spice-pumpkin-pie/</guid>
      <description>Pumpkin pie was one of the first things I ever learned how to bake! I originally used the Libby’s pumpkin pie recipe, but after a while, I got sick of baking the same recipe again and again. So I started to tinker with the recipe, and I came up with the idea of using Chinese five spice instead of pumpkin pie spice. It gives the pie so much more depth of flavor.</description>

      <description>Creamy, spicy, savory, coconutty…this soup is possibly one of the best things I’ve ever made. My family definitely agrees – whenever I make this, it’s gone in a day! It’s a great comfort food for winter and also great to make in the summer, since I always crave spicy food in the summer. I love this soup so much!</description>

      <title>Jian Bing Crepe</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/jianbing-crepe/</guid>
      <description>My dad&amp;rsquo;s favorite food is probably jian bing, a Chinese street food that usually consists of a crispy buckwheat or whole-wheat crepe filled with egg, black bean sauce, scallions, sometimes lettuce, and a crispy cracker or fried dough piece. As a little bit of fun, this Father&amp;rsquo;s Day I made a version using French crepe batter, which produces a different result than the traditional Chinese Version &amp;ndash; but still really good. I don&amp;rsquo;t have the crepe pan that street vendors typically use to make jian bing, but I made do with what I had. This dish is essentially my recreation of a jian bing, just a little bit simpler and quicker to make at home.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/creamy-tomato-penne/</guid>
      <description>I love pasta alla vodka, but it does require two pots – one to boil the water, and one to make the sauce. I was craving a good tomatoey pasta the other night, and I happened to have the idea to try a one-pot version, where the pasta cooks in the sauce (please don’t come for me, Italians.) The pasta turned out delicious, and it was so easy to make that I knew I had to put it in a recipe!</description>

      <title>5 Ingredient Peanut Butter Blossoms</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/5-ingredient-peanut-butter-blossoms/</guid>
      <description>Peanut butter cookies are usually a big disappointment for me. Peanut butter cookies tend to bake up very dry because of the way that the extra fat in the peanut butter affects the cookie texture. And that&amp;rsquo;s a huge shame, because peanut butter flavored cookies sound like such a good idea in your head.</description>

      <title>Rice Paper Sushi</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/rice-paper-roll/</guid>
      <description>My family sometimes likes to make sushi at home. Granted, it&amp;rsquo;s probably not very authentic, but it still tastes pretty good. We usually make it with surimi, cucumber, and avocado; sometimes we swap surimi for smoked salmon. So, how did this recipe come about? A few weeks ago I was grocery shopping and bought some rice paper, mostly because I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it being used a ton of ways on Instagram and wanted to give it a try. When my family was making sushi together later that weekend, I looked at the rice paper and came up with a neat idea &amp;ndash; why not use it in sushi?</description>

      <title>Brown Rice &#39;Jambalaya&#39; (Instant Pot Recipe!)</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/jambalaya/</guid>
      <description>I love jambalaya. It’s traditionally not pescetarian, so I swapped chicken for mushrooms and used vegetarian sausage to make my version. I also used brown rice instead of white rice, since that’s my family’s favorite type of rice. It also adds body to the jambalaya, so I prefer using it, even though it isn’t traditional. Since I don’t usually have the patience to cook the rice on a stovetop, I used my instant pot instead to make it.</description>

      <description>Banana bread is a classic recipe, and it definitely got a lot more popular during COVID lockdown. My dad makes an awesome banana bread that I&amp;rsquo;ll always have nostalgia for, but I was recently looking to develop a recipe for a moister banana bread. I ended up combining a banana bread recipe with a recipe for coffee cake (because who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love streusel?) and it turned out really nicely.</description>

      <description>I love caramelized onions. And mushrooms. And goat cheese. So I thought, why not put them all on top of a puff pastry base? It’s the perfect mix of sweet, savory caramelized onions and tangy, creamy goat cheese.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/vegetarian-gua-bao/</guid>
      <description>Gua bao is a dish I grew up with! Basically, it&amp;rsquo;s often eaten as a split bun stuffed with pork belly and cucumber and sometimes other toppings like cilantro. Although as a child, my strongest memory is taking those split buns and making them into odd fusion PB&amp;amp;J sandwiches! After I went pescetarian, I missed having gua bao, so I came up with a vegetarian substitute that swaps mushrooms for pork belly. It tastes just as good!</description>

      <description>Salmon is a popular and easy dinner to make. A common way to make it is roasting it in the oven, which I used to do all the time. Except the problem is, I kept ending up with overcooked salmon, because the oven was too hot. And using the oven is such as hassle – you have to preheat it, and defrost the salmon, and what not.</description>

      <description>Roasted broccoli is simple, healthy, and versatile. It’s a quick recipe, easy to customize, and surprisingly addictive. I made a batch of roasted broccoli a few days ago, and my family snacked on it before dinner until half of it was gone!</description>

      <description>Fried rice is one of my favorite meals to make. It’s the perfect clean-out-the-fridge dinner, and it’s quick and so easy to cook. Growing up, my grandparents would make egg fried rice with leftover pork or even ham and frozen mixed vegetables.</description>

      <description>I know this probably sounds weird, but ratatouille + shakshuka is a surprisingly good combo. If you’ve never heard of ratatouille before, it’s a French Provencal vegetable stew typically made with the freshest of summer produce – zucchini, tomatoes, eggplant. Shakshuka is a dish of eggs poached in tomato sauce, which has many variations that can be found around the Mediterranean and Northern Africa.</description>

      <description>Unlike chives, which you’d normally think of as an aromatic, garlic chives are treated like a vegetable and used in stir-fries, dumpling fillings, and more. My favorite way to cook them is very simple, just quickly stir-fried with some scrambled eggs. The chives bring a refreshing, delicious flavor to the dish, and it’s absolutely delicious! It’s also so quick to whip up for dinner on a busy day.</description>

      <description>Steamed eggs, or what I called 炖蛋 growing up, has always been one of my comfort foods. My grandma used to make it for me when I was sick, and it was one of the first things I learned how to cook. It&amp;rsquo;s also so simple &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s just a savory, super simple steamed egg dish. It&amp;rsquo;s technically an egg custard, but that sounds scary, and this isn&amp;rsquo;t complicated or scary at all. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard of the Japanese dish chawanmushi or the Korean dish gyeran-jjim, this is in a similar vein. It&amp;rsquo;s lowkey, homey, and comforting, and as a bonus you&amp;rsquo;re practically guaranteed to have the ingredients you need to make it at home.</description>

      <description>I conquered my fear of salads with this peach and burrata caprese. I made it for my parents’ anniversary dinner, and they loved it. Since it’s peach season, I threw in peaches with the classic tomato and basil caprese salad. I also replaced the traditional mozzarella with burrata, because I think it makes the salad more cohesive. It’s a super simple salad, dressed with just a drizzle of good balsamic vinegar.</description>

      <title>Easy Shrimp Cocktail (2 ways!)</title>

      <description>I know you can buy the elements at the store, but I prefer to make this shrimp cocktail from scratch. It’s only a few ingredients and takes barely any time at all. Plus, it’s better made fresh. For a spin on the classic, I replaced the typical super-sweet ketchup with a homemade tomato sauce that’s tomatoey, spicy, just the right amount of sweet, and absolutely delish. I also made another version with a mango chili dipping sauce, which is an awesome combination with the shrimp!</description>

      <description>Cauliflower wings are an awesome vegetarian snack! I first made cauliflower wings when I made vegetarian buffalo wings for the Super Bowl, but I don’t love buffalo sauce, so I came up with a sesame-honey version instead. The sauce is sticky, sweet, and garlicky, and the cauliflower wings are deliciously crunchy.</description>
