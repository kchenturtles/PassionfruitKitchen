      <description>Wow, I&amp;rsquo;m excited about this one! It&amp;rsquo;s so simple yet so good - I think I&amp;rsquo;ve made it like six times this month already. I call it a sunshine smoothie bowl because of the color, but to be more specific it&amp;rsquo;s an amazing tropical smoothie bowl - mango, pineapple, banana (and anything else you might want to add!) I&amp;rsquo;ve got a neat trick as well for making sure it&amp;rsquo;s thick enough to scoop.</description>

      <description>A lot of muffins I find in stores are very sweet and very dry, so I prefer to make my own. Homemade muffins are the best, especially warm out of the oven. They only need a bowl and a whisk, and they’re so easy to customize! My recipe has no refined sugar and has oats for added fiber and texture.</description>

      <title>5 Spice Pumpkin Pie</title>

      <description>Pumpkin pie was one of the first things I ever learned how to bake! I originally used the Libby’s pumpkin pie recipe, but after a while, I got sick of baking the same recipe again and again. So I started to tinker with the recipe (to the delight of my family, of course) and I came up with the idea of using Chinese five spice instead of pumpkin pie spice. It gives the pie so much more depth of flavor.</description>
