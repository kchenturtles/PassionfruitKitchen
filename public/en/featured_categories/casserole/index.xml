      <description>This recipe actually came about at my sister&amp;rsquo;s request! She was visiting home and telling me about this dish she makes at college: lasagna with butternut squash. When I at first heard that, I was so skeptical &amp;ndash; after all, it seems like something that would get you in trouble with generations of Italian tradition. But she likes it a lot, so I figured that I would give it a try and see if I could improve on it.</description>
