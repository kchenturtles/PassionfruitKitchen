      <title>Microwave Steamed Eggs</title>

      <description>Steamed eggs, or what I called 炖蛋 growing up, has always been one of my comfort foods. My grandma used to make it for me when I was sick, and it was one of the first things I learned how to cook. It&amp;rsquo;s also so simple &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s just a savory, super simple steamed egg dish. It&amp;rsquo;s technically an egg custard, but that sounds scary, and this isn&amp;rsquo;t complicated or scary at all. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard of the Japanese dish chawanmushi or the Korean dish gyeran-jjim, this is in a similar vein. It&amp;rsquo;s lowkey, homey, and comforting, and as a bonus you&amp;rsquo;re practically guaranteed to have the ingredients you need to make it at home.</description>

      <description>This is a great appetizer that looks fancy, tastes amazing, and is actually very simple to make! It&amp;rsquo;s a riff on Baked Brie, which is a common holiday appetizer, but redesigned to be in the form of shareable pastries.</description>

      <title>Savory Crepe, Jian Bing Style</title>
      <link>https://kchenturtles.github.io/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/jianbing-crepe/</link>

      <guid>https://kchenturtles.github.io/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/jianbing-crepe/</guid>
      <description>My dad&amp;rsquo;s favorite food is probably jian bing, a Chinese street food that usually consists of a crispy whole-wheat crepe filled with egg, black bean sauce, scallions, sometimes lettuce, and a crispy cracker or fried dough piece. As a little bit of fun, this Father&amp;rsquo;s Day I made a version using French crepe batter, which produces a smoother and softer crepe than the traditional Chinese Version. I don&amp;rsquo;t have the plate that vendors typically use to make jian bing, but I made do with what I had. This dish is essentially my recreation of a jian bing, just a little bit simpler and quicker to make!</description>

      <title>Vegetarian Gua Bao</title>
      <link>https://kchenturtles.github.io/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/vegetarian-gua-bao/</link>

      <guid>https://kchenturtles.github.io/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/vegetarian-gua-bao/</guid>
      <description>Gua bao is a dish I grew up with! Basically, it&amp;rsquo;s often eaten as a split bun stuffed with pork belly and cucumber and sometimes other toppings like cilantro. Although as a child, my strongest memory is taking those split buns and making them into odd fusion PB&amp;amp;J sandwiches! After I went pescetarian, I missed having gua bao, so I came up with a vegetarian substitute that swaps mushrooms for pork belly. It tastes just as good!</description>

      <title>Crispy Rice Paper Wrap</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back with the rice paper, because I&amp;rsquo;ve still got some left! Rice paper is also really good for crisping up, and it makes a really cool substitute for a tortilla in a breakfast egg wrap. This recipe is somewhat inspired by the Chinese dish jian bing, which has eggs and scallions on top of a crepe with black bean sauce. I tried out swapping the tortilla with rice paper, and it turned out great!</description>

      <title>Rice Paper Sushi Rolls</title>

      <description>My family likes to make sushi at home. Granted, it&amp;rsquo;s probably not very authentic, but it still tastes great! We usually make it with surimi, cucumber, and avocado, sometimes we swap surimi for smoked salmon. So, how did this recipe come about? Well, a few weeks ago I was grocery shopping and bought some rice paper, mostly because I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it being used a ton of ways on Instagram and wanted to give it a try. When my family was making sushi together later that weekend, I looked at the rice paper and came up with a neat idea &amp;ndash; why not wrap sushi in it?</description>

      <title>Valentines Day Dango</title>

      <description>Happy Valentines Day! In honor of the holiday, I figured I should take advantage of that bottle of pink food coloring in my baking cabinet (fun fact, it’s the only color I have!) This is inspired by hanami dango, which is one of the cutest desserts I’ve ever had. I love dango because they are so simple, not to sweet, and so chewy. Traditionally hanami dango are pink, white, and green, but I made it with just pink and white for Valentines Day!</description>

      <title>Slow Cooker Applesauce</title>
      <link>https://kchenturtles.github.io/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/slow-cooker-applesauce/</link>

      <description>I had wayyy too many apples in the fridge. Like, maybe 15? Some of them were getting far too old, and it was time to use them up. Usually with apples, I would make apple crisp or apple pie, but with robotics season starting I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time. So my solution? Slow cooker applesauce! It&amp;rsquo;s great because you can set it and forget it until it&amp;rsquo;s ready, it tastes great, and it makes the house smell so cozy, which is just what you need in these winter months. (Now the only question is squeezing 10 apples into my slow cooker&amp;hellip;)</description>

      <title>Egg Toast</title>

      <description>This winter, I got introduced to Korean egg toast, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I&amp;rsquo;ve had it like every day this week. It&amp;rsquo;s so good &amp;ndash; the softest, fluffiest egg ever, folded into sweet brioche bread and topped with the perfect sweet-and-savory sauce. My favorite toast also has cheese and avocado! Of course I had to try to figure out how to make it at home, so here is what I came up with!</description>

      <title>Four-Cheese Cheesy Shells</title>

      <guid>https://kchenturtles.github.io/PassionfruitKitchen/en/posts/cheesy-shells/</guid>
      <description>This is a pretty awesome mac and cheese recipe. It&amp;rsquo;s got tons of flavor, and it uses shell pasta instead of elbow macaroni because shells are the superior shape (I will die on this hill). It&amp;rsquo;s extra saucy, because the saucier the better. It&amp;rsquo;s salty, cheesy, and has a bit of a kick (adjustable levels!) Peak comfort food right here.</description>

      <description>Fried rice is one of my favorite meals to make. It’s the perfect clean-out-the-fridge dinner, and it’s quick and so easy to cook. Growing up, my grandparents would make egg fried rice with leftover pork or even ham and frozen mixed vegetables.</description>

      <description>When I was young, we used to get takeout from this one place in Chinatown (I don’t know the name, sadly.) I specifically remember this one dish I loved: their stir-fried shrimp and eggs.</description>

      <title>Garlic Chive &amp; Egg Stir Fry</title>

      <description>Unlike chives, which you’d normally think of as an aromatic, garlic chives are treated like a vegetable and used in stir-fries, dumpling fillings, and more. My favorite way to cook them is very simple, just quickly stir-fried with some scrambled eggs. The chives bring a refreshing, delicious flavor to the dish, and it’s absolutely delicious! It’s also so quick to whip up for dinner on a busy day.</description>

      <description>Creamy, spicy, savory, coconutty…this soup is possibly one of the best things I’ve ever made. My family definitely agrees – whenever I make this, it’s gone in a day! It’s a great comfort food for winter and also great to make in the summer, since I always crave spicy food in the summer. I love this soup so much!</description>

      <title>Brown Rice &#39;Jambalaya&#39; (Instant Pot Recipe!)</title>

      <description>I love jambalaya. It’s traditionally not pescetarian, so I swapped chicken for mushrooms and used vegetarian sausage to make my version. I also used brown rice instead of white rice, since that’s my family’s favorite type of rice. It also adds body to the jambalaya, so I prefer using it, even though it isn’t traditional. Since I don’t usually have the patience to cook the rice on a stovetop, I used my instant pot instead to make it.</description>

      <description>I love pasta alla vodka, but it does require two pots – one to boil the water, and one to mix the sauce. I was craving a good tomatoey pasta the other night, and I happened to have the idea to try a one-pot version, where the pasta cooks in the sauce (please don’t come for me, Italians.) The pasta turned out delicious, and it was so easy to make that I knew I had to put it in a recipe!</description>

      <title>Ratatouille Shakshuka</title>

      <description>I know this probably sounds weird, but ratatouille + shakshuka is a surprisingly good combo. If you’ve never heard of ratatouille before, it’s a French Provencal vegetable stew typically made with the freshest of summer produce – zucchini, tomatoes, eggplant. Shakshuka is a dish of eggs poached in tomato sauce, which has many variations that can be found around the Mediterranean and Northern Africa.</description>

      <title>Honey Soy Salmon</title>

      <description>Salmon is a popular and easy dinner to make. A common way to make it is roasting it in the oven, which I used to do all the time. Except the problem is, I kept ending up with overcooked salmon, because the oven was too hot. And using the oven is such as hassle – you have to preheat it, and defrost the salmon, and what not.</description>

      <title>Broccoli Cheddar Soup</title>

      <description>Who else loves broccoli cheddar soup? I adored it as a kid, but really only from Panera Bread. Unfortunately, I’ve had quite a few bad broccoli cheddar soups in my life (school cafeteria, anyone?) — floury, bland, watery, and sometimes the broccoli inside would still be crunchy (yikes). But Panera’s was really good: creamy, savory, and deliciously cheesy.</description>

      <description>Fritattas are a great dish to make anytime: They’re easy to whip up, and they’re great for pretty much any meal. Plus, they’re super customizable, and you can use them to clean leftover produce out of your fridge. You can customize the mix-ins if you desire!</description>
