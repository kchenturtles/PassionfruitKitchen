I love pasta alla vodka, but it does require two pots – one to boil the water, and one to mix the sauce. I was craving a good tomatoey pasta the other night, and I happened to have the idea to try a one-pot version, where the pasta cooks in the sauce (please don’t come for me, Italians.) The pasta turned out delicious, and it was so easy to make that I knew I had to put it in a recipe! It’s a great weeknight dinner, and I hope you try it too!

On another note, I finally got Lightroom! Now I can edit photos so the lighting/coloring isn’t always so weird :). So I hope you enjoy the properly-edited photos in this post.

## Ingredients

This recipe is pretty low-key, and many of the ingredients are easy to substitute. Truly a pantry pasta recipe! You’ll need:

- Butter
- Garlic
- Short-cut pasta of your choice (I used penne, but you could also use anything from fusilli to gemelli.)
- Canned tomato sauce, or crushed tomatoes, or tomato puree (even diced tomatoes might work!)
- Evaporated milk, cream, or milk
- White wine
- Vegetable broth or chicken stock
- Tomato paste (optional)
- Parmesan cheese (or Pecorino-Romano, or whatever you have)

## Making Creamy Tomato Pasta

You’ll start by sauteing the garlic and tomato paste, then deglaze the pan with the white wine. Add the broth and tomatoes, and bring them to a boil. Then, add in your pasta.

Let the pasta cook in the liquid until softened but not quite cooked through. Add in the milk/cream, and continue to cook until al dente. Stir in some butter and parmesan to finish, and you’re done! So easy!

## Tips

- It is okay if the pasta is a bit saucy when it is fully cooked — it will thicken up as the pasta cools.
- If you find that when all the liquid has boiled away the pasta isn't fully cooked yet, add some more stock.
- You can also add herbs and seasonings if you like!
