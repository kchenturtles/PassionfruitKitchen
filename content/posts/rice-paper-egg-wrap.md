I'm back with the rice paper, because I've still got some left! Rice paper is also really good for crisping up, and it makes a really cool substitute for a tortilla in a breakfast egg wrap. This recipe is somewhat inspired by the Chinese dish jian bing, which has eggs and scallions on top of a crepe with black bean sauce. I tried out swapping the tortilla with rice paper, and it turned out great! It's also very easy to swap out fillings and sauces depending on what you like.

## Ingredients

This recipe is simple but very customizable! You'll need:

- Rice paper
- Eggs
- Oil
- Scallions
- Any fillings you think of! Vegetables, black bean sauce, chili oil, and even more unconventional toppings like smoked salmon or cheese all make creative toppings.

## Making Rice Paper Wraps

After heating up oil in a pan, you'll actually put the rice paper right on top of it -- dry. This helps it crisp up. Then, you can crack some eggs on top, and once they're mostly cooked, add your toppings. You can shape it however you want, as a wrap like I did, or as a pocket, or even as a pizza if you just leave it flat!

## Tips

- If you want your rice paper crispy, make sure the oil is hot when you put it in! 
- Start adding the toppings when the eggs are partially cooked -- just to make sure you don't overcook them.
- Some ideas for toppings and sauces include chili oil, black bean sauce, oyster sauce, peas, scallions, and cilantro!
