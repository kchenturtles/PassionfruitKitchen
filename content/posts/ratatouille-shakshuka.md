I know this probably sounds weird, but ratatouille + shakshuka is a surprisingly good combo. If you’ve never heard of ratatouille before, it’s a French Provencal vegetable stew typically made with the freshest of summer produce – zucchini, tomatoes, eggplant. Shakshuka is a dish of eggs poached in tomato sauce, which has many variations that can be found around the Mediterranean and Northern Africa.

This dish came to be after I made ratatouille and shakshuka separately, and I had leftover shakshuka sauce and leftover ratatouille vegetables. So I came up with the idea of mixing them together, and I added poached eggs just like shakshuka normally has. It’s the perfect balance of flavors!

## Ingredients

To make this dish, you will need:

- Olive oil
- Onion
- Garlic
- Red bell pepper
- Eggplant
- Zucchini
- Tomato paste
- Diced tomatoes
- Vegetable stock or chicken broth
- Eggs

## Making Ratatouille Shakshuka

This dish is super simple to make, and can be made in just one skillet! The base is made like a simplified ratatouille, and then you just crack a bunch of eggs into the sauce and let them poach.

Start by sauteing diced onion and garlic for flavor. Then add your vegetables and saute until beginning to soften. Add the tomato paste and diced tomatoes and simmer, adding stock as needed to thin the sauce.

Once your vegetables are fork tender, crack in some eggs – as many as you like!

Cover the pot and let the eggs poach in the sauce until just set.

## Tips

- You can customize the base if you like — if you don’t like ratatouille, you can use your own mix of vegetables and make it more like a hash.
- If tomatoes are in season, feel free to substitute canned diced tomatoes with fresh ones!
- Cook the eggs to your liking of doneness – if you like them to have a more solid yolk, cook them for a bit longer. I don’t usually time them; I just stop when they’re at my desired point of cooking.

1. Dice onion and chop zucchini, eggplant, and bell pepper into even chunks.
2. In a large pan over medium-high heat, saute garlic in olive oil. Add onion and saute until translucent.
3. Add zucchini, eggplant, and bell pepper to the pan and stir-fry until beginning to soften.
4. Mix in tomato paste and diced tomatoes. Add broth to thin the sauce out. Simmer until the vegetables are fork-tender, about 10 minutes.
5. Crack in eggs (as many as you can fit in the pan!) and cover the pan. Let poach until cooked to your desired degree, occasionally rotating the pan to ensure even cooking.
6. Enjoy!
