summary: "My dad's favorite food is probably jian bing, a Chinese street food that usually consists of a crispy whole-wheat crepe filled with egg, black bean sauce, scallions, sometimes lettuce, and a crispy cracker or fried dough piece. As a little bit of fun, this Father's Day I made a version using French crepe batter, which produces a smoother and softer crepe than the traditional Chinese Version. I don't have the plate that vendors typically use to make jian bing, but I made do with what I had. This dish is essentially my recreation of a jian bing, just a little bit simpler and quicker to make!"

My dad's favorite food is probably jian bing, a Chinese street food that usually consists of a crispy whole-wheat crepe filled with egg, black bean sauce, scallions, sometimes lettuce, and a crispy cracker or fried dough piece. As a little bit of fun, this Father's Day I made a version using French crepe batter, which produces a smoother and softer crepe than the traditional Chinese version. I don't have the crepe maker that vendors typically use to make jian bing, but I can make do with what I have. This dish is essentially my recreation of a jian bing, just a little bit simpler and quicker to make!

## Ingredients

Making this recipe is as easy as making a crepe and adding some unique toppings!

For the crepes, you'll need:
- Btter
- Flour
- Salt
- Milk
- Water
- Eggs

For the fillings, you'll need:
- Eggs
- Scallions
- Black bean sauce for topping
- Optionally, some crispy fried wonton crackers, sesame seeds, fried dough, lettuce, or anything else to give it some crunch!

## Making Jianbing Crepes

You'll start by making the crepe batter, which comes together quickly in a large mixing bowl. Be sure not to over-stir, which will make them tough. A blender comes in handy here. 

The jian bing element just comes from cracking an egg onto one side of the crepe and spreading it out. Sprinkle on some scallions and cook through, and you've got a jian bing crepe! Then it's just a matter of adding whatever fillings you desire.

## Tips

- It is okay if the pasta is a bit saucy when it is fully cooked â€” it will thicken up as the pasta cools.
- If you find that when all the liquid has boiled away the pasta isn't fully cooked yet, add some more stock.
- You can also add herbs and seasonings if you like!

1. In a large mixing bowl, sift in the flour and salt. 
2. Add melted butter, milk, water, and eggs. Stir to combine, until mostly smooth. The crepe batter should be runny to the point of being pourable. If it is not, you may need to add more water or milk. As an alternative to mixing by hand, you can use a blender for the crepe batter.
3. To make a crepe, pour 1/4 cup of batter into an oiled pan over medium heat and spread it by rotating the pan. Once the crepe becomes solid and lacy around the edges, flip it over. If you find your crepe is getting burned too quickly, turn down the heat. 
4. Once you've flipped your crepe, crack an egg on that side. Spread it into a layer using a spoon or spatule. The egg doesn't need to be beaten; streaks of egg yolk and white are good. Just be sure to break up the yolk and spread it around. 
5. Sprinkle the egg with scallions and sesame seeds. 
6. Once both sides of the crepe are done cooking, the egg should be solid. Transfer the crepe to a plate. 
7. Add the sauce, crackers, and other fillings before folding it up. 
8. Enjoy!
