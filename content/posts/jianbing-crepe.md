summary: "My dad's favorite food is probably jian bing, a Chinese street food that usually consists of a crispy whole-wheat crepe filled with egg, black bean sauce, scallions, sometimes lettuce, and a crispy cracker or fried dough piece. As a little bit of fun, this Father's Day I made a version using French crepe batter, which produces a smoother and softer crepe than the traditional Chinese Version. I don't have the plate that vendors typically use to make jian bing, but I made do with what I had. This dish is essentially my recreation of a jian bing, just a little bit simpler and quicker to make!"

My dad's favorite food is probably jian bing, a Chinese street food that usually consists of a crispy whole-wheat crepe filled with egg, black bean sauce, scallions, sometimes lettuce, and a crispy cracker or fried dough piece. As a little bit of fun, this Father's Day I made a version using French crepe batter, which produces a smoother and softer crepe than the traditional Chinese Version. I don't have the plate that vendors typically use to make jian bing, but I made do with what I had. This dish is essentially my recreation of a jian bing, just a little bit simpler and quicker to make!

## Ingredients

This recipe is pretty low-key, and many of the ingredients are easy to substitute. Truly a pantry pasta recipe! You’ll need:

- Butter
- Garlic
- Short-cut pasta of your choice (I used penne, but you could also use anything from fusilli to gemelli.)
- Canned tomato sauce, or crushed tomatoes, or tomato puree (even diced tomatoes might work!)
- Evaporated milk, cream, or milk
- White wine
- Vegetable broth or chicken stock
- Tomato paste (optional)
- Parmesan cheese (or Pecorino-Romano, or whatever you have)

## Making Creamy Tomato Pasta

You’ll start by sauteing the garlic and tomato paste, then deglaze the pan with the white wine. Add the broth and tomatoes, and bring them to a boil. Then, add in your pasta.

Let the pasta cook in the liquid until softened but not quite cooked through. Add in the milk/cream, and continue to cook until al dente. Stir in some butter and parmesan to finish, and you’re done! So easy!

## Tips

- It is okay if the pasta is a bit saucy when it is fully cooked — it will thicken up as the pasta cools.
- If you find that when all the liquid has boiled away the pasta isn't fully cooked yet, add some more stock.
- You can also add herbs and seasonings if you like!
