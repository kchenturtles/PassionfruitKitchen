I love garlic chives, or jiu cai in Chinese. They don’t really taste like garlic, or like chives – they’re a unique flavor of their own. Unlike chives, which you’d normally think of as an aromatic, garlic chives are treated like a vegetable and used in stir-fries, dumpling fillings, and more. My favorite way to cook them is very simple, just quickly stir-fried with some scrambled eggs. The chives bring a refreshing, delicious flavor to the dish, and it’s absolutely delicious! It’s also so quick to whip up for dinner on a busy day.

## Ingredients

This dish only needs a few ingredients!

- Garlic chives

## Making Garlic Chive & Egg Stir Fry

Making this stir fry is just like making scrambled eggs. First, you’ll beat the eggs in a large bowl with the seasonings. Saute the chives over high heat with a bit of water to encourage them to wilt. Then, add in the eggs, and scramble them together until the chives are wilted and the eggs are fully cooked.

## Tips

- Remember to adjust seasonings to taste! Traditionally you don’t add soy sauce to this, but you can try adding oyster sauce if you want more umami flavor.
- Mushroom bouillon and dried shrimp give the eggs extra umami, so try to include them if you can!
- If you want to keep this dish vegetarian, just omit the dried shrimp.
