Salmon is a popular and easy dinner to make. A common way to make it is roasting it in the oven, which I used to do all the time. Except the problem is, I kept ending up with overcooked salmon, because the oven was too hot. And using the oven is such as hassle – you have to preheat it, and defrost the salmon, and what not.

Enter this honey soy salmon. You can cook it from frozen, and it’s just made in one pan. You add the sauce mixture and let it cook down with the salmon, infusing it with all the delicious teriyaki-esque flavor. And it’s never overcooked!

## Ingredients

This recipe needs only a few ingredients!

- Salmon fillets
- Garlic
- Shaoxing wine or mirin
- Rice vinegar
- Soy sauce
- Honey
- Sesame seeds
- Cooking oil

## Tips

- It’s important to keep the heat fairly low, especially when cooking the salmon from frozen. This way, you can make sure the salmon cooks all the way through without overcooking on the outside!
- You can tell that the salmon is cooked through when it is opaque and firm all the way through. It should flake easily as well.
- If you don’t have honey, you can use basically any other sweetener instead, such as sugar, rice syrup, or agave.
- Be sure to adjust the sauce to taste! You could also add ginger and chopped scallions for extra flavor.
