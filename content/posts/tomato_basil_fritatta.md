Do you have a dish you think you could eat every day and never get tired of?

This is that dish for me. I make it every other week, and I’ve yet to get tired of it. It’s a simple frittata (baked egg dish) that I typically make with spinach, mushrooms, and cheese. It’s so low-key, you could probably make it in your sleep if you wanted. I jazzed it up by adding some cherry tomatoes, but you can add any leftover vegetables, potatoes, salmon…whatever you have in your fridge! Do it your way, and enjoy this easy, simple recipe!

Fritattas are a great dish to make anytime: They’re easy to whip up, and they’re great for pretty much any meal. Plus, they’re super customizable, and you can use them to clean leftover produce out of your fridge. You can customize the mix-ins if you desire! I sometimes swap out tomatoes and spinach for kale, mushrooms, sweet potatoes, bell peppers, onions, asparagus, or sausages. If you use other vegetables, I would recommend still precooking them before putting them into the casserole.

## Ingredients

- Baby spinach, mushrooms, and tomatoes (or mix-ins of your choice!)
- Minced garlic
- Eggs
- Shredded cheddar cheese (or any other cheese, crumbled or shredded into pieces)
- Salt and pepper

## Making The Fritatta

The first step is to prep and chop all your mix-ins, and par-cook anything that needs to be pre-cooked before being baked in the fritatta. This typically includes things that release a lot of water, like spinach and mushrooms, and things that might take longer to cook, like potatoes. (If you’re adding potatoes, I suggest actually pre-roasting them instead of pre-cooking them on the stove.)

Then, beat your eggs and add the cheese. Arrange your mix-ins in a pie pan, and pour the egg mixture overtop. Bake until set, and enjoy!

## Mix It Up!

Don’t get bored of the same flavor combination again and again! Here are some of my ideas for variations:

- Roasted red bell pepper, sundried tomatoes and goat cheese
- Vegetarian sausage and potatoes (breakfast-hash style!)
- Spinach and feta
- Caramelized onion and Gruyere
- Broccoli and cheddar cheese
- Asparagus, peas, and leeks for a spring vibe
- Salmon, cream cheese, and onion
- Tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil
- Vegetarian bacon, cheddar, and scallion

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
