When I was young, we used to get takeout from this one place in Chinatown (I don’t know the name, sadly.) I specifically remember this one dish I loved: their stir-fried shrimp and eggs. Hilariously, back then I hated shrimp for some reason! However, I loved this dish so much, and I would just eat the eggs because they were so savory and delicious (probably infused with the shrimp’s flavor, yet I still refused to eat the shrimp?)

The other day, I accidentally bought WAY too many eggs. Like, at home we had 36, and I forgot to count the eggs before grocery shopping, so I went and bought…another 36. So I had 72 eggs, and quite a dilemma on hand. I ended up making basically only egg dishes that week, including this dish, stir-fried garlic chives and eggs, tea eggs, frittata, and soy-marinated eggs.

I really love eggs.

But the point is, you should try this dish! It was so easy to throw together out of just a few pantry staples, even after cooking eggs, like, 10000 ways all day. And it’s so delicious and nostalgic!

## Ingredients

This recipe is only six ingredients, and half of them are seasonings!

- Eggs
- Shrimp: You can use frozen shrimp here, and it works great!
- Frozen peas
- Shaoxing wine
- Mushroom bouillon powder: My “natural MSG.” If you don’t have it, you can just use salt instead. BUT, if you can find it, definitely use it, because it’s so good.
- Sugar: Just a little bit, to boost the flavor!

## Making Shrimp & Egg Stir-Fry

This recipe is super simple to make: you basically just throw everything in a wok and cook it together. If you’re using frozen shrimp, you’ll want to add that to the wok first so it can defrost. Beat your eggs with the seasonings, and add them in. Finally, add the frozen peas.

Then, cook until the eggs are done, and that’s it!

## Tips

- To save time, buy pre-peeled and deveined shrimp. This dish is best with smaller shrimp (50-60 count).
- If you don’t want to add peas, you can add another vegetable of your choosing – perhaps garlic chives! Or, you can just leave them out.

1. In a medium mixing bowl, beat together eggs, wine, salt, sugar, and mushroom bouillon powder until homogenous.
2. Heat a wok or skillet pan over high heat. Add in the shrimp and cook until lightly pink and beginning to curl. Time may vary depending on whether you are using frozen shrimp.
3. Pour in eggs and begin to stir. If you want smaller curds, stir more frequently; if you want larger curds, stir less often.
4. When eggs are beginning to set but still somewhat runny, add in frozen peas.
5. Continue to stir-fry until eggs and peas are fully cooked.
6. Serve hot and enjoy!
