summary: "Wow, I'm excited about this one! It's so simple yet so good - I think I've made it like six times this month already. I call it a sunshine smoothie bowl because of the color, but to be more specific it's an amazing tropical smoothie bowl - mango, pineapple, banana (and anything else you might want to add!) I've got a neat trick as well for making sure it's thick enough to scoop."

Wow, I'm excited about this one! It's so simple yet so good - I think I've made it like six times this month already. I call it a sunshine smoothie bowl because of the color, but to be more specific it's an amazing tropical smoothie bowl - mango, pineapple, banana (and anything else you might want to add!) I've got a neat trick as well for making sure it's thick enough to scoop. The ingredients for this smoothie bowl are also super simple -- just some frozen fruit and yogurt -- and blended together it tastes just like mango sorbet!

## Ingredients

- Frozen mango cubes
- Frozen pineapple cubes
- Banana
- Greek yogurt or dairy-free coconut yogurt
- Honey
- Granola for topping

## Tips

- Smoothie bowls are simple -- you just dump everything in a blender or food processor and blend! I use a food processor because the motor on my blender is rather burnt out. Food processors are great for making thick smoothies, although a powerful blender works just as well.
- Feel free to customize your ingredients and toppings however you like! I've swapped out pineapple for frozen peaches before and had some excellent results. If you feel like adding some veggies, you could also throw in a handful of spinach.
- I used a kiwi, some yogurt, and granola to top my smoothie bowl for the photos, but you can top it with whatever you like!
