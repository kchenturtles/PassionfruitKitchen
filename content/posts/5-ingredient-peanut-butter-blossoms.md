Peanut butter cookies are usually a big disappointment for me. Peanut butter cookies tend to bake up very dry because of the way that the peanut butter affects the cookie texture. And that's a huge shame, because peanut butter is so delicious on its own! However, the other day, I came across a recipe that seemed very promising: a flourless peanut butter cookie recipe. Suspend your disbelief, because removing the flour from the recipe actually improves the texture by a mile. These cookies bake up moist, dense, and chewy to boot. Even better: It's only 4 ingredients! Of course, a classic style of peanut butter cookie is a peanut butter blossom, and with extra Hershey's kisses around, I just had to make them into blossoms. What's just one more ingredient when you're only using 4? Definitely a great decision. You've got to try these!

## Ingredients

You only need 5 ingredients (which you probably already have in your cupboard, so what are you waiting for?)

- Dark brown sugar
- Eggs
- Smooth peanut butter (avoid using natural peanut butter for this recipe)
- Vanilla extract
- Hershey's Kisses

## Tips

- These are generous cookies! A great trick to portion them out easily is to use an ice cream scoop.
- If the dough feels too soft to work with, try chilling it before scooping.
- Try to use a peanut butter without much added sugar/salt. If you would like, you can add 1/2 - 1 tsp of salt into the dough when you are making the cookies.

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
2. In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs, vanilla extract, and sugar together until frothy and well combined.
3. Fold in the peanut butter using a spatula. The dough should be shiny and thick. 
4. Using a large scoop, portion the dough into approximately 3-tablespoon balls. Top each ball with a chocolate kiss.
5. Bake for 20 minutes or until set and puffed up slightly. Let cool and enjoy!
