Roasted broccoli is simple, healthy, and versatile. It’s a quick recipe, easy to customize, and surprisingly addictive. I made a batch of roasted broccoli a few days ago, and my family snacked on it before dinner until half of it was gone! Roasting broccoli brings out great flavor and crisps up the florets. If you’ve ever had steamed broccoli, you’ll know just how bad soggy broccoli is…but never fear, roasted broccoli is the answer!

If you’ve ever roasted vegetables before, you’ll know the annoyance of pulling a pan of them out of the oven only to see the tops burnt and the bottoms raw. My solution to this problem? Halfway through the roasting time, pull out the pans and toss the vegetables around so they have flipped over. Then quickly put them back into the oven, and get ready to have beautifully cooked veggies!

The ingredients for this recipe are simple: you just need broccoli, a dash of olive oil, and seasonings! You can customize the seasonings as you want. I usually use a pinch of salt and pepper, but you can add things like garlic powder, lemon juice, or cheese if you want!

## Serving Suggestions
- Chop the florets into small pieces and use them in a roasted broccoli salad.
- Similarly, roasted broccoli is great in a grain bowl — sweetgreen has an excellent roasted broccoli warm bowl that I like to recreate at home.
- Roasted broccoli with Parmesan makes a great snack – a healthy alternative to cheese puffs!
- Enjoy it as a side dish with some roasted salmon!

## Tips

- Cut broccoli into consistent-size florets so they cook at the same rate in the oven.
- Ovens can run high – meaning if it is set to 400 degrees, it may actually be hotter. If your broccoli is beginning to burn, you may want to turn down the temperature. Similarly, if your broccoli is not cooked by the end of the listed time, you can keep it in for a bit longer!
- If you want to use less oil, you can also try using cooking spray.
- Don’t put too many florets on one roasting pan – this will keep them from cooking evenly and browning properly.
- If you are adding a hard cheese like Parmesan, add it at the end, tossing it with the florets after they come out of the oven. A softer, more meltable cheese like shredded cheddar can be baked with the florets, but hard grated cheeses will burn in the oven.
