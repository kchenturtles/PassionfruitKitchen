![peach burrata caprese](../../categories/salads.jpeg)

To be honest, the thing I’m the worst at making is salads. I’m always chopping the ingredients too small, or leaving them too big. I overdress them or underdress them. And bad salads don’t keep very long – they get pretty gross if you forget about them in the back of the fridge for a week (guilty).

But I conquered my fear of salads with this peach and burrata caprese. I made it for my parents’ anniversary dinner, and they loved it. Since it’s peach season, I threw in peaches with the classic tomato and basil caprese salad. I also replaced the traditional mozzarella with burrata, because I think it makes the salad more cohesive. It’s a super simple salad, dressed with just a drizzle of good balsamic vinegar. Make it with fresh summer produce; it’ll be gone before you can sit down!

## Ingredients

This is a super simple salad. It has just 5 ingredients, but they make such an excellent combination.

You will need:

- Peaches: Fresh, ripe summer peaches are the best. However, if you’re craving this salad out of season, you can use canned sliced peaches – rinse and drain them before using.
- Tomatoes: Summer is tomato season! Pick a large, firm one. Heirloom tomatoes are especially tasty.
- Burrata cheese: Burrata cheese is basically a ball of mozzarella cheese with a creamy, soft center. Slice it in wedges to get a bit of that yummy center in each piece.
- Fresh basil
- Balsamic vinegar

## Tips

- Slice your ingredients fairly thinly to make the salad more cohesive.
- If you want to plate this salad fancily, you can lay the basil, tomato, and peach first and then break open a piece of burrata on top.
