summary: "This is a pretty awesome mac and cheese recipe. It's got tons of flavor, and it uses shell pasta instead of elbow macaroni because shells are the superior shape (I will die on this hill). It's extra saucy, because the saucier the better. It's salty, cheesy, and has a bit of a kick (adjustable levels!) Peak comfort food right here."

I admit, "cheesy shells" is a fancy way of saying mac and cheese. However, this is a pretty awesome mac and cheese recipe. It's got tons of flavor, and it uses shell pasta instead of elbow macaroni because shells are the superior shape (I will die on this hill). It's extra saucy, because the saucier the better. It's salty, cheesy, and has a bit of a kick (adjustable levels!) Peak comfort food right here.

## Ingredients

- Pasta
- Milk
- Vegetable broth
- Cheddar cheese
- Fontina cheese
- Cream Cheese
- Shredded Parmesan
- Paprika
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- Mustard Powder
- Butter
- Flour

## Tips

- We start by making a roux: melting butter, adding flour, and whisking. Be sure to mix it until it isn't clumpy and the smell of flour has dissapated. Rouxes are used to thicken sauce, like our cheese sauce.
- I typically prefer to buy solid blocks of cheese and shred it by hand. Packaged shredded cheese can have additives that may make the sauce grainy. However, I do buy parmesan pre-shredded. 
- You can customize the amounts of salt, pepper, nutmeg, paprika, and mustard powder that you add. If you prefer more of a kick, add more to your pasta. If you want to add something else, like garlic or onion powder, you can do that too!
