Wow, it's been busy recently! I've been sticking to the simple recipes to get by: just a couple of ingredients, not too many dishes dirtied, less prep work. Luckily for me, these vegetarian pigs in a blanket check all of those boxes, and they taste great!

## Ingredients

You'll need quite literally just two ingredients, and both you can just get from the store with no prep. 

- Vegetarian hot dogs (I like Lightlife, but you can use any brand you prefer)
- Canned croissant rolls

## Tips

- You can cut the hot dogs and crescent dough triangles in half to make small snacks for a crowd. That will make 16 instead of 8.
