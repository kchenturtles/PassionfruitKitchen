Shrimp cocktail is such a 60’s dish to most people, am I right? But it’s actually really good. Especially for me, since I love shrimp and I’m not old enough to remember the 60’s. I know you can buy the elements at the store, but I prefer to make this shrimp cocktail from scratch. It’s only a few ingredients and takes barely any time at all. Plus, it’s better made fresh. For a spin on the classic, I replaced the typical super-sweet ketchup with a homemade tomato sauce that’s tomatoey, spicy, just the right amount of sweet, and absolutely delish. I also made another version with a mango chili dipping sauce, which is an awesome combination with the shrimp! I hope you enjoy!

## Ingredients

If you’re making the tomato sauce, you’ll need:

- Tomato puree
- Ketchup (just a little)
- Red pepper flakes
- Worcestershire sauce
- Lemon juice

If you’re making the mango chili sauce, you’ll need:

- Mango
- Lime juice
- Honey
- Chili sauce such as sambal oelek
- Rice vinegar (optional)

To assemble, you need:

- Shrimp
- Lemon wedges for serving

## Tips

- The shrimp are cooked through when they are fully opaque and pink.
- If your sauces are a little too thick, add some water until it’s your desired consistency.
- Don’t forget to adjust your sauce to taste! If you like it more acidic, add some more lime/lemon juice, and if you like it spicy, add more chili!
- Make sure to let the shrimp cool before you serve! You can make the sauce while the shimp is cooling.
- The typical way to serve shrimp cocktail is by arranging the shrimp around the edge of a glass or a bowl filled with sauce. You can also put the shrimp around the edge of a large bowl and put the sauce in a smaller bowl in the middle.
