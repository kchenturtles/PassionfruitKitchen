summary: "I had wayyy too many apples in the fridge. Like, maybe 15? Some of them were getting far too old, and it was time to use them up. Usually with apples, I would make apple crisp or apple pie, but with robotics season starting I didn't have time. So my solution? Slow cooker applesauce! It's great because you can set it and forget it until it's ready, it tastes great, and it makes the house smell so cozy, which is just what you need in these winter months. (Now the only question is squeezing 10 apples into my slow cooker...)"

I had wayyy too many apples in the fridge. Like, maybe 15? Some of them were getting far too old, and it was time to use them up. Usually with old apples, I would make apple crisp or apple pie, but with robotics season starting I didn't have time. So my solution? Slow cooker applesauce! It's great because you can set it and forget it until it's ready, it tastes great, and it makes the house smell so cozy, which is just what you need in these winter months. (Now the only question is squeezing 10 apples into my slow cooker...)

## Ingredients

You can actually make an excellent and healthy applesauce with just 3 ingredients -- and one of them is water! No sugar needed, and it still comes out very sweet!

- Apples -- any type, a mix is good. McIntosh make great applesauce, as do Golden Delicious and Empire.
- Cinnamon and any other spices desired
- Water

## Making Applesauce in the Slow Cooker

The most work you have to do in this recipe is chop the apples. You don't even have to peel them! Once you've got your cubed apples, you just throw them in the slow cooker with some water and leave it to simmer for several hours, until the apples are soft and breaking down into a mush. Then you can blend it into a smooth puree, and enjoy!

## Tips

- It is better to aim for more water rather than less -- you don't want to burn your slow cooker!
- Be careful blending the cooked apples into applesauce, as you may want to let them cool a bit first.
- If, after blending, you want your applesauce a bit thicker, you can pour it back into the slow cooker and let it cook down.
