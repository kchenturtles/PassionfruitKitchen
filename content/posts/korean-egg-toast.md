This winter, I got introduced to Korean egg toast, and I'm pretty sure I've had it like every day this week. It's so good -- the softest, fluffiest egg ever, folded into sweet brioche bread and topped with the perfect sweet-and-savory sauce. My favorite toast also has cheese and avocado! Of course I had to try to figure out how to make it at home, so here is what I came up with!

Korean egg toast, or gilgeori toast, is a dish often sold by street vendors in Korea. Often the egg has vegetables like cabbage folded in, but my recipe is based off of the version more commonly sold in America, which is just eggs, sometimes with avocado and cheese.

## Ingredients

There are four main components to this sandwich: the sweet mayo sauce, the egg, the fillings, and the bread. You will need:

- Brioche bread, sliced
- Eggs
- Milk
- Mayo
- Honey
- Cheddar cheese, sliced
- Avocado

## Making Egg Toast

The most time-consuming part of making egg toast is just making the eggs! The trick to making the eggs soft and fluffy is to add a splash of milk, and make sure not to overcook them. 

The sauce is super simple, just a sweet mayo (although you can add a little bit of hot sauce if you want a kick to it.) You don't even have to toast the bread if you don't feel like it! Keep things low-key. :)

## Tips

- Brioche is the best type of bread because its sweetness nicely compliments the mayo sauce. If you can't find brioche, challah is an excellent subsitute, as is good old Pullman sandwich bread.
- Don't stir the eggs too much while cooking them; stick with a gentle folding motion. This will keep the eggs together and will keep the sandwich from falling apart. 
- Mix it up! Although I don't eat meat, it's popular to put meat into these sandwiches. Some options include bacon, ham, sausage, and Spam.

1. Start by laying out all of your bread, to prepare for sandwich making.
2. In a small mixing bowl, place in the mayonnaise and the honey/agave, and stir them together until it forms a homogenous sauce. Add more mayo or honey as needed to adjust to taste.
3. Beat all of the eggs and milk together in a large mixing bowl. Pour the mixture into a large skillet over medium heat. 
4. Once the eggs begin to cook, divide it into loose fourths as best as you can with a large spatula. Fold and flip over each fourth. It should form one neat block of eggs. 
5. Once the eggs are cooked -- it's okay if they are a little bit soft still, that is the desired texture -- remove them from the heat. Place each egg parcel on one piece of bread. Top each egg parcel with a slice of cheddar cheese and some avocado.
6. Spread the sweet mayo over the top piece of bread, the ones without the egg. 
7. Close the sandwiches, slice, and enjoy!
