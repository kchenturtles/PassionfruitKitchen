summary: "Pumpkin pie was one of the first things I ever learned how to bake! I originally used the Libby’s pumpkin pie recipe, but after a while, I got sick of baking the same recipe again and again. So I started to tinker with the recipe (to the delight of my family, of course) and I came up with the idea of using Chinese five spice instead of pumpkin pie spice. It gives the pie so much more depth of flavor."

My family LOVES pumpkin pie. I love experimenting with baking new dishes – everything from coffee cake to cinnamon rolls – but nothing ever seems to disappear as fast as this pumpkin pie.

## Ingredients

Pumpkin pie is actually pretty simple to make. It's a custard pie, so it's stabilized with eggs, and contains dairy! You can use many store-bought components if you don’t have a lot of time (like me) and it still tastes great! You will need:

- 1 pie crust of your choice (I used a frozen pie crust, no regrets, but you can make one from scratch if you feel up to it!)
- Brown sugar: This adds an addictive caramel note to the pie.
- Cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger
- Chinese five spice: This is a blend of spices that includes star anise, cloves, and cinnamon. You could also try many other unusual spice blends — I think garam masala, chai spice, quatre épices, or even ras el hanout would be fantastic! Of course, you can also use regular pumpkin pie spice.
- Flour: This adds a little bit more body to the pumpkin pie and helps stabilize it.
- Eggs
- Pumpkin puree: Canned pumpkin puree is great – and basically indistinguishable from fresh pumpkin, so use canned puree without regret!
- Evaporated milk

## Tips

- Par-baking the crust helps it stay crisp and flaky in the oven. Line it with parchment paper and pie weights so it doesn’t sink! You can also use dried rice/beans or sugar as pie weights.
- The pie is done when it is puffed and set around the edges but still sunken a bit in the center. Removing it at that point will keep the pie from cracking, and the center will cook through as the pie cools.
- Ovens can run at different temperatures, so be sure to keep an eye on your pie! If the crust is browning too fast, cover it with a little bit of aluminum foil.

You can use a gluten-free pie crust and use cornstarch instead of flour to make this recipe gluten-free. To store it, cover the top with plastic wrap and refrigerate.
